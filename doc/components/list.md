# &lt;list&gt;(&lt;vlist&gt;,&lt;hlist&gt;)
<span class="weex-version">0.4</span>


### Summary

A fixed height container which has multiple child components (cells) arranged in one column. If total height of its child components is higher then the height of itself, the whole child components are scrollable and it's high-performanced.   

**Notes:** height of `list` must be specified (list's styles must contain `height` or pair of `top`, `bottom` or flex value if outter container's `flex-direction` value is `column`).

### Orientation
The `list` is alias of `vlist` which display component in vertical oritentation, and `hlist` for the horizontal scroll component.   

### Child Components

* `cell` is a available candidate to be used as a child component for `list`.
* `refresh` component can be used inside list to add pull to refresh functionality.
* `loading` component can be used inside list to add loading view at the bottom of scroller.

### Attributes

- `loadmoreoffset`: &lt;number&gt; the offset distance downwards the bottom of the list to trigger the loadmore event, which is triggered when the list scrolls down near enough to the bottom.

Other attributes please check out the [common attributes](../references/common-attrs.md).

- `transform`: &lt;string&gt; define item transformation. See next section for mmore detail.

### Item Transformation
The `tranform` attribute allow you tranlate,rotate,scale and change transparency of item according distance between item and list component's center. Item right in middle has no transformation applied.   

The value is a simple expression, like    
```
transform(value,[...valueN]);[...transformN(value,[...valueN]);]
```   
Very similar to the 2D transform in CSS3.   
For example,    
```
transform="scale(0.5,0.5);translate(100,0)" 
```    
This means the item will scale to 50% of the origin size and translate 100 in x axis when it arrive the edge of list component.   
**The value you set is the transform will apply to the Edge-Item**.   
These transform functions are supported:  
- `scale(x,y)`: scale item, x and y should be a positive float number. 
- `translate(x,y)`: translate item, `x` and `y` shoule be integer numbers. 
- `opacity(n)`: change the transparency of item, `n` must in `[0,1.0]`.
- `rotate(n)`: rotate item, n is integer number.
